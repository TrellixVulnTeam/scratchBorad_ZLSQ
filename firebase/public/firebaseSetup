Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be
structured and when your data can be read from and written to. You can keep
these rules in your project directory and publish them with firebase deploy.

? What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json
+  Wrote database.rules.json

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? public
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
+  Wrote public/index.html

=== Project Setup

Now that your Firebase project directory is set up, it's time to associate
it with a project. You can create multiple project aliases by running
firebase use --add, but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? What Firebase project do you want to associate as default? [create a new project]
